# Deleeper

## Detecting Sleepers | Sleeping Driver Detection and Warning

## What does Deleeper solve?
There are several cases of road accidents daily due to drivers **feeling sleepy, drowsy** or due to them **being drunk**, as a result of which **they lose control of their vehicles**, and therefore **result in different road accidents**.

To solve or eradicate this problem with proper **Deep Learning** algorithms, we have brought to you the project entitled "**Deleeper**", which **detects sleeping or drowsy people** (especially, **drivers** or **students**) and alerts them with a **continuous sound**, and makes them able to focus in what they are doing; i.e. **driving properly/safely** or **stopping at the sides of the road for a short rest**.

## Challenges Faced
The major hassle that we ran into while building this project was during training the **Deep Learning model** using **Convolution Neural Networks** (**CNNs**), in which we spent a lot of our times on. Also, at the initial phase, we were facing a lot of issues with **Keras** and **TensorFlow** integration. 

We trained our model making use of different **Amazon AWS** services from the **AWS Educate Starter Account** from **GitHub Student Developer Pack**, therefore our project makes use of three different tracks; **Data Science and AI**, **IoT** and **the Cloud**. 

Later on, we came across different bugs while implementing the **Haar feature-based Cascade Classifier algorithms** for face and eyes detection.

So, in overall, the majority of our challenges were related with implementing different **Deep Learning algorithms**, and we didn't have much issues while training our model in the Cloud and developing the user interface for our project.
